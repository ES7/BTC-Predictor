# BTC-Predictor
Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital currency that operates on a decentralized network using blockchain technology. It was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto and was released as open-source software in 2009.

In this project, I am developing a Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), is particularly well-suited for sequence prediction problems due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies. Given the highly volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets, accurately forecasting BTC prices can provide significant insights for traders and investors. This model aims to analyze historical price data and predict future BTC price movements, helping users make more informed trading decisions.

I have collected BTC price data from May 2016 to May 2024, spanning **8 years**, using the `Historic_Crypto` library. The code to scrape the data is inside **`Data_Collection.ipynb`** file.<br>
The size of this data is **0.265 GB**, which made it difficult to upload to GitHub. Therefore, I broke down the data file into four parts and uploaded their zip files.
